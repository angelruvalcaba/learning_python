# You have been given the code above
# An example command line is
#	python3 translate.py ATGCGCCCGAACTAG ATGAAACCCGGGTTT
# Your task is to write a new program with the following features
# 1. Proper command line (argparse)
# 2. Reads sequences in from fasta format rather than sys.argv
# 3. Outputs sequences as fasta format
# 4. Accepts both uppercase and lowercase letters
# 5. Translates ambiguous amino acids as X (e.g. for weird codons)

# Hints
# 1. add functions and put them in your library
# 2. use string.upper() to normalize case
